## Teaching Experience

In Spring 2024, I will serve as lecturer for [a graduate applied statistics course at Harvard](s052_syllabus_spring2024.pdf).

In the past, I have served as a teaching fellow for Harvard courses on

-   Intermediate and Applied Statistics (EDUS052)

-   Quantitative Text Analysis (EDUS059)

-   Data Science (EDUS043)

-   Introductory Applied Statistics (EDUS040)

In these roles, I developed and taught material on programming, statistical methods, and natural language processing.

## Teaching Evaluations

-   [Data Science](S022_Spring2023.pdf) (2023)

-   [Quantitative Text Analysis](S059_Spring2023.pdf) (2023)

(I do not have access to evaluations from pre-2023 due to Harvard changing its evaluation system)

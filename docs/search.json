My research has been funded by the Institute for Education Sciences and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Current projects include\n\nZero-shot learning methods coupled with generalized method of moments estimators to measure pedagogical practices from teachers’ speech data\nHigh-dimensional word embeddings and permutation testing to identify words and phrases whose usage differs by group. I use this method to explore language differences between highly effective and less effective teachers\nA computational method to assess the sensitivity of regression discontinuity results to possible data manipulation\n\n\n\nPublished Works\n\nThe important role that teachers play in students’ development of mathematical language (Under Review)\nA multi-site RCT that identifies an effective intervention for reducing absenteeism in early grades (Peer Reviewed)\nThe role of standardized testing in college admissions (Peer Reviewed)\n\n\n\nBio\nI received my AM in Statistics from Harvard, where I am currently finishing my PhD in education policy. Previously, I worked as a research analyst at Harvard’s Center for Education Policy Research under the mentorship of Doug Staiger and Thomas Kane. In that role, I developed statistical software for Bayesian analyses of rapid cycle randomized control trials. Since then, I have continued to develop statistical software; currently, alongside Reagan Mozer and Luke Miratrix, I am developing RctText, an R package for impact analyses with text data as the outcome. My PhD commitee includes my advisor Sebastian Munoz-Najar, Luke Miratrix, and Andrew Ho.\nI have also interned with J-PAL Global at MIT, worked at Conversica (a tech company), and served in the Peace Corps. My other collaborators include Dora Demzsky, Heather Hill, and Jing Liu.\nIf you are interested in hiring a consultant or contractor for analytic work, email me. I am excited to work with you!"
